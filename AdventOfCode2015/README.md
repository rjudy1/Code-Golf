## Advent of Code 2015 in Python

### Challenges
1. follow floor move instructions (it offends me that santa starts counting from 1)
2. surface area + min surface slack, min perimeter + volume (aah reading comprehension)
3. visited locations from steps
4. md5 hash pre+int beginning with 5 and 6 zeros (again, could parallelize search)
5. match strings to certain rules
6. change chunks of values in array
7. trace through circuit (no feedback, try and remember to erase the set value for b already present)
8. match and compact/encode escape sequences
9. brute force a hamiltonian tour because why not
10. look and say sequence (caching could help for more iterations)
