## Advent of Code 2015 in Python

### Challenges
1. follow floor move instructions (it offends me that santa starts counting from 1)
2. surface area + min surface slack, min perimeter + volume (aah reading comprehension)
3. visited locations from steps
4. md5 hash pre+int beginning with 5 and 6 zeros (again, could parallelize search)
5. match strings to certain rules
6. change chunks of values in array
7. trace through circuit (no feedback, try and remember to erase the set value for b already present)
8. match and compact/encode escape sequences
9. brute force a hamiltonian tour because why not
10. look and say sequence (caching could help for more iterations)
11. incrementing alphabetic strings
12. process flattened json to sum numbers and numbers not in a red object
13. score happiest permutation of seating input + self
14. reindeer positions with rest and speed cycles (paused to writeup video call)
15. mixed integer maximization of score s.t. calorie and ingredient limit (brute force combos)
16. find match to template characteristics (could just do by hand/parse while reading to save space)
17. count combos/min count combos of containers storing 150 units (could efficient DP or add early sorted skip)
18. 100 steps of conways (a minute lost because initial state has to be fixed too)
19. expand/reduce string molecule patterns to target (final solution relies on aoc specific tree grammar but included dfs of search space code for generality even if horrible state space explosion)
20. count house gifts from elves that deliver only to multiples of their id (slow :\\)
21. boss battle min win, max loss based on hitpoints, defense
22. wizard battle min win with different spells (annoying ordering details dijkstra, could A*/memoize more)
23. super basic cpu (concerningly simple for a day 23)
24.
