## Advent of Code 2025 in Python

### Challenges
1. count turns of 100 tick dial that land on/pass zero (incompetency at speed reading achieved lol)
2. sum invalid ids that are composed of repeating sequences of digits (SUM not COUNT, multitasking for the L)
3. find largest two/twelve digit number formable by pulling from string of numbers without changing order (really not my best look at speed this week)
4. remove rolls with less than four neighbors repeatedly
5. count numbers in input ranges and inputs in input ranges (new policy: if suspect off by one, just resubmit with new guess, ranges don't start at zero)
6. line and entire input transposed reverse polish
7. count path splits and unique paths to end (using cache to restrain global count increments is hacky and inconsistent)
8. greedily connect nodes by distance until circuit reaches certain size/becomes single connected component (fyi nx size != len, fscope)
9. find largest rectangle with opposite corners in input and then rectangle within polygon formed from input (interesting shape you've got there)
10.
