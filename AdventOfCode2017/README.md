## Advent of Code 2017 in Python

### Challenges
1. sum all values that immediately match the next digit/halfway digit
2. sum difference of largest and smallest values and then quotient of divisible numbers in row
3. use incrementing spiral and sum of existing neighbors spiral to find distance to value and value > input (did this by hand and then wrote code)
4. validate duplicate words/anagrams in passphrase
5. instruction jump counter with incrementing instructions (manual solution, kind of lame)
