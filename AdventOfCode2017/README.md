## Advent of Code 2017 in Python

### Challenges
1. sum all values that immediately match the next digit/halfway digit
2. sum difference of largest and smallest values and then quotient of divisible numbers in row
3. use incrementing spiral and sum of existing neighbors spiral to find distance to value and value > input (did this by hand and then wrote code)
4. validate duplicate words/anagrams in passphrase
5. instruction jump counter with incrementing instructions (manual solution, kind of lame)
6. find memory reallocation loop (wasted a full minute with an off by one error) with brent's tortoise hare
7. find the base tower and the one that needs changed for balance (paused between to take an interview lol)
8. \*CPU instructions\*, find max register
9.
