## Advent of Code 2017 in Python

### Challenges
1. sum all values that immediately match the next digit/halfway digit
2. sum difference of largest and smallest values and then quotient of divisible numbers in row
3. use incrementing spiral and sum of existing neighbors spiral to find distance to value and value > input (did this by hand and then wrote code)
4. validate duplicate words/anagrams in passphrase
5. instruction jump counter with incrementing instructions (manual solution, kind of lame)
6. find memory reallocation loop (wasted a full minute with an off by one error) with brent's tortoise hare
7. find the base tower and the one that needs changed for balance (paused between to take an interview lol)
8. \*CPU instructions\*, find max register
9. \*parser state machine\* to count garbage and score group depth
10. perform knot hash and convert output of extended hash to hex (not terrible delay between stages for multitasking)
11. hex coordinates (3D, sort of)
12. connected components size and count (did bfs manually and then remembered networkx)
13. moving scanners catching along top file
14. count used spaces in grid from hashed key (knot hash day 10b) (I should really stop doing these while doing something else, it's cutting into the splits)
15. generators (story and implementation)
16. letters in patterns, cycle detection (why do I even bother with splits if I'm going to solve while in meetings)
17. circular buffer (linked list) adding after input steps and tracking after 2017 and 0
18. \*mini assembly coroutines\* (very not generalized)
19. follow the graphic path
20. 3D particle dynamics (acc dominates for a) and elimination by collision in space (b)
21. expanding array art (technically doesn't work on example because the instructions are incomplete)
22. simulation of virus spread with nodes changing state upon encounter (suspiciously easy)
23. count composites in a range (disguised as jumbled assembly)
24. build highest strength bridge with two sided nodes (memoized dfs with bitmask)
25. process formatted pseudocode for fixed steps
