## Advent of Code 2022 in Python

### Challenges
1. Split a data file twice and find the top 3 sums of each batch
2. Rock, paper, scissors strategy guide options
3. Set intersection within row and between three rows
4. Subset and intersection checks
5. move stacks of crates either in batches or one at a time
6. shifting window of unique characters
7. Determine file system from cd and ls commands (build tree), sum sizes of directories less than 1000000 
(dfs setting up tree), determine the smallest file needed to delete for update
8. check visibility from outside and inside grove of trees (dumb approach)
9. snake but tries to keep in the same col or row instead of simple following head
10. Assembly-esque instructions to draw pixels
11. passing numbers, have to reduce scale by mod of LCM of moduli (chinese remainder theorem ftw)
12. djikstra elevation maze
13. recursive comparison of nested lists
14. simulate falling sand (key of maintaining previous path up to last)
15. optimizing iterations and structures (positions in massive grid where beacons could and couldn't be)
16. djikstra preliminary filter to map, dfs with memoization of sequences, then find best combos in cache
17. straight simulate tetris placement until repetition, then finish after repeats
18. compute surface area given points and then only exposed SA by taking border and inside SA of that
19. maximize geode collection with linear programming (learning about z3) (why day 16 again, \*cry\*)
20. circular list of numbers shifting
21. given values and operations down tree, compute value of root function, backtrack to humn for b (might be \*FAVORITE\* so far)
22. travel map with wraparound to non blank and then actually folds into cube (will solve all inputs but not technially generic)
23. keep spreading out elves until sufficiently spaced given scatter rules
24.
