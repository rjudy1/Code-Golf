## Advent of Code 2018 Challenges

### Usage
This repo contains solutions to the Advent of Code 2018 challenges. Most are general use; if not, instructions
are in the code.
If you replace the input filename with your own input, in the data folder, or the input variable in
the case of very short inputs, you can run with your inputs. Some also require changing of the part, stage,
or phase variable to 1 and 2 to get the part you want, as the layout was modified as the contest progressed. 

The programs use the parseMod module and should be interpreted through anaconda to resolve the path names or the extra
sys and module libraries may have to be used (see parseMod.py). Most later programs account for this additional import.
Thus, you will need the new repo. None of the programs should take more than 30 seconds, generally less, and otherwise
specified. Enjoy!
