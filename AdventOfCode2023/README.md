## Advent of Code 2022 in Python

### Challenges
1. First and last digit/spelled out digit on each line is value, sum values
2. Is game possible with set number of dice, how many dice needed to be possible, ugh parsing
3. Parse numbers from lines of characters based on adjacencies, flip
4. Scratchcard scoring based on match count, recursive acquisition of cards with backward iteration
5. Multiple dictionary pass through mappings (1 to 1), split into ranges (could assign to ranges instead of repropagating)
6. Find whole numbers between quadratic roots of -t^2 + race_time * t - race_record_distance (for once, no horrible parsing)
7. Poker ordering of hands with five of a kind down to high card, twist of wildcard joker
8. Count steps in following graph to ZZZ and then from all ending in A to something simultaneously ending in Z
9. propagate difference of each line of values until line of zeroes, then backpropagate from end and beginning
10.
