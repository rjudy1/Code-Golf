## Advent of Code 2022 in Python

### Challenges
1. First and last digit/spelled out digit on each line is value, sum values
2. Is game possible with set number of dice, how many dice needed to be possible, ugh parsing
3. Parse numbers from lines of characters based on adjacencies, flip
4. Scratchcard scoring based on match count, recursive acquisition of cards with backward iteration
5. Multiple dictionary pass through mappings (1 to 1), split into ranges (could assign to ranges instead of repropagating)
6. Find whole numbers between quadratic roots of -t^2 + race_time * t - race_record_distance (for once, no horrible parsing)
7. Poker ordering of hands with five of a kind down to high card, twist of wildcard joker
8. Count steps in following graph to ZZZ and then from all ending in A to something simultaneously ending in Z
9. Propagate difference of each line of values until line of zeroes, then backpropagate from end and beginning
10. Find main loop in a mess of pipes and find area enclosed by loop (expand and bfs, shoelace might be better)
11. Calculate manhattan distance between galaxies with empty rows/cols expanding
12. Nonograms with incomplete patterns, try possible placements of groups and count working versions
13. Find reflecting line, then alternate reflecting line made possible by one change
14. Roll rocks fully in direction based on rotation; look for pattern of states
15. Hashing operation applied to assign labels and values into boxes
16. Fire beams of light through mirrors, store number of spaces beam passes through
17. Djikstra with constraints of min 3 consecutive steps in a direction, 4<=streak<10 for b,
18. Shoelace formula for area inside polygon
19. Split ranges based on sequential conditionals
20. Conjunctions and flip flops to settle for 1000 button presses, then until rx gets 1
21. Find positions possible at exact number of steps, then with infinite grid
22. Drop straight blocks at various 3D orientations and determine which blocks can be removed and cost of removing others
23. DFS traversal of routes with momentum term
24. Find hailstone paths that collide and create hailstone to collide with all
25. Find three connections to cut that split the ports into two groups, visualize with graphviz
