## Advent of Code 2024 in Python

### Challenges
1. find mse difference between sorted values and then sum(value * freq2) (if only I could read)
2. filter reports of increasing/decreasing in bounds, brute force :<
3. look for regex patterns matching "mul\(\d+,\d+\)", "do\(\)", "don't\(\)" and process (did i build a giant state machine that solved both parts before just using the regex library in the refactor? maybe)
4. find patterns in word search (kinda boring scan of grid)
5. given instructions and ordering, build DAG with predecessors, validate and fix order
6. discover path through map with right turns, see where single obstacles create loop, brute force with a path follow optimization
7. find combination of operators (+,*,||) that make equations work with BFT search (take that, exponential)
8. find nodes in line with antennas (equidistant and then all) (why are antenna positions included in the antinodes?!)
9. defragment chunks of memory back into gaps/then only full gaps (kind of disgusting to have to do this ngl, brute force)
10. score of each trailhead (number of peaks reached) summed, then number of unique paths (who needs a visited set anyway)
