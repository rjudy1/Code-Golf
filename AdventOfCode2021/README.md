## Advent of Code 2021 in Rust

Add additional whitespace for num col parser to read in

### Challenges
1. count increases in list, then sliding window increases
2. submarine position and aim
3. find most/least common bits and match incrementally
4. bingo first win and last
5. crossing lines of hydrothermal vents
6. lanternfish countdown and multiply; buckets
7. min distance between points with cost function to move; brute force
8. seven segment breakdown; pen and paper elimination of matching segs
9. local minima count and basin size; dfs
10. character pairs inside others; recursive stack match closure
11. flash expansion of octopi; recursive dfs variation
12. path count through graphs; dfs
13. display transparent paper image after folds
14. expand polymer pairwise; buckets
15. find best path through maze; djikstra bfs
16. parse packet hex strings with header and nested packets; recursion
17. parabolic discrete velocity/position; brute force loops with creative edges
18. string parsing of special sums; parsing pain or smarter tree method (solution has calculate_clean and calculate as options to solve)
19. 3D triangulation; orient the beacons via rotations and positioning
20. enhance image with key (sneaky flash); iterative
21. play around a board based on deterministic and then parallel universe dice; frequencies and weighting
22. count cubes in a 3D space; use cuboids and track edges
23. towers of hanoi game; done by hand with help of simulator
24. alu code; repeats for each digit in same pattern with slightly different numbers on lines 4,5, and 15; reverse engineer the code and store the max/min prefix per z at each stage to save space
25.
