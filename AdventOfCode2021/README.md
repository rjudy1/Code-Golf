3. find most/least common bits and match incrementally
4. bingo first win and last
5. crossing lines of hydrothermal vents
6. lanternfish countdown and multiply; buckets
7. min distance between points with cost function to move; brute force
8. seven segment breakdown; pen and paper elimination of matching segs
