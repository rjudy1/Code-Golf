# Advent of Code 2019 
12.1.10-12.13.20

### Resources
intcodecomputer.py - created from assembly up to Day 13 for use with any Intcode problem

### Usage
This repo contains solutions to the Advent of Code 2019 challenges. The programs should all be general use,
although a few may require some special changes - refer to the comments of its corresponding python file
and check for a phase, part, or stage variable near the top. (Day 3 and 20 have some special instructions.)
If you replace the input filename with your own input, in the data folder, or the input variable in
the case of very short inputs, you can run with your inputs. Some also require changing of the part or phase
variable to 1 and 2 to get the part you want, as the layout was modified as the contest progress. 

The programs use the parseMod module and should be interpreted through anaconda to resolve the path names or the extra
sys and module libraries may have to be used (see parseMod.py). Thus, you will need the full repo. None of the
programs should take more than 30 seconds, generally less and otherwise noted. Enjoy!
