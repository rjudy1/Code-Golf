## Advent of Code 2016 in Python

### Challenges
1. follow turn and move instructions, tracking visited
2. follow step directions within bounds of a keypad
3. triangle inequality checks
4. parse most frequent letters, then caesar cipher shift by id (exactly what phrase to search for could be more clear)
5. md hash parsing (annoyingly slow, could parallelize)
6. most and least common value in columns
7. match abba not in square brackets and aba/\[bab\] pairs (that was annoying regex-thinking-wise)
8. circular shift rows/columns (only a can be auto submitted, b must be visually inspected)
9. recursive expansion of compressed repetitions in string
10. bots passing to fixed neighbors based on magnitude, find output bot and specific interaction (not particularly clever but works)
11. bfs min steps to move items to a top floor without keeping invalid pairs together per step (kind of annoying)
12. basic assembly
13. infinite positive maze min steps to target and distinct reachable locations

19. josephus problem k=2 and k=3
20. find numbers < 2**32 that are not in the listed ranges
21. 
22. 
23. d12 assembly + toggle; reverse engineer the assembly (deconstruction assumes same program except key constants)
24. 
25. d12 assembly + d23 tgl + out
